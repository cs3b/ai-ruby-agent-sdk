# Let's Start Command

This command helps initialize your development session with proper context.

## Process Steps

1. Load Environment:
   - First, run the [Load Environment](./load-env.md) command to get a comprehensive view of the project structure, context, and environment

2. Test-Driven Development Approach:
   - Create tests for each feature before implementation
   - Run `bin/rspec` to verify test failures initially
   - Add implementation to make tests pass

## Success Criteria

1. Environment Loaded:
   - Confirmed all steps in the Load Environment command are completed
   - Project structure and context understood

2. Development Ready:
   - Test framework available and understood
   - Current tasks identified and prioritized
   - Implementation approach planned with TDD in mind
