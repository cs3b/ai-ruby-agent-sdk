Below is a Markdown document outlining the updated feature request with a checklist of tasks and a sample Ruby DSL. This version adds support for MCP server configuration (to run the tool with all parameters, environment variables, etc., assuming STDIO communication) and a unified “call” method that executes the tool when the LLM requests it.

Unified Tool Registry Feature Request with Configuration and Call Method

Overview

This feature adds the following capabilities to the unified tool registry:
	•	MCP Server Configuration:
Define how to start and interact with an MCP server using STDIO (including command, environment variables, working directory, etc.).
	•	Call Method:
Provide a unified call method for every tool. This method will:
	•	Receive input from the LLM or agents.
	•	Validate the input using safety checks.
	•	Execute the tool by using the supplied configuration (for MCP servers, by running a command via STDIO; for APIs or command‑line utilities, by making the appropriate call).
	•	Validate and return the output.

The registry must support various tool types:
	•	MCP server to control browsers (with options to whitelist/blacklist specific capabilities).
	•	MCP server for directory operations.
	•	Command‑line tool (e.g., converting HTML to Markdown).
	•	API endpoint (e.g., a simple currency exchange API).

Feature Checklist
	•	MCP Server Configuration
	•	Add a DSL config block for MCP servers.
	•	Define parameters such as command, environment variables, and working directory.
	•	Store the configuration for later use during the call.
	•	Call Method Implementation
	•	Add a DSL call block that specifies how the tool is executed.
	•	Validate input using the defined safety checks before executing.
	•	Run the tool (via STDIO, system calls, API requests, or command‑line invocation).
	•	Validate output against safety checks after execution.
	•	Return the resulting output for use by the LLM or agents.
	•	DSL Consistency
	•	Ensure that the DSL supports defining name, description, schema (input/output), safety validations, configuration (for MCP servers), and the call method.
	•	Provide examples for each tool type (MCP server browser controller, directory manager, cmd tool, API endpoint).
	•	Documentation and Testing
	•	Document how to use the DSL including examples.
	•	Define tests to verify that the call method correctly executes the tool and that safety checks are enforced.

Sample DSL in Ruby

Below is a sample Ruby DSL that illustrates how to define tools. The DSL includes support for MCP server configuration and the call method.



Summary

This document outlines the following:
	•	Feature Requirements:
	•	A unified tool registry with support for MCP server configuration (command, environment variables, working directory) using STDIO.
	•	A call method that validates input/output via safety checks and executes the tool.
	•	DSL Enhancements:
	•	A config DSL block for MCP configuration.
	•	A call DSL block to define how the tool is executed.
	•	Support for whitelisting/blacklisting capabilities for MCP servers.
	•	Sample DSL Code:
	•	Provided DSL code defines four sample tools:
	•	MCP server for browser control.
	•	MCP server for directory management.
	•	Command-line tool for HTML-to-Markdown conversion.
	•	Simple currency exchange API endpoint.

This design enables seamless integration of different tool types within a unified registry while ensuring that each tool is defined in a way that is understandable by both developers and the LLM. Feedback on the configuration details, safety validation rules, and call semantics will help fine-tune the system further.
