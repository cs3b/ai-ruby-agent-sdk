ticket draft:

commands lets-start and load-env have some duplication

would be nice to be able to load single prompt to the coding agent - something like combine this commands and related documents references in this documents into a single command in context of current session

- [ ] let's ensure we don't duplications
- [ ] rething about having agent (or prompt) that prepares environment (context) for the session
