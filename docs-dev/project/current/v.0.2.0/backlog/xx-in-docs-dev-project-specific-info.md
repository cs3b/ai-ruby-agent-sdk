ticket draft:

In docs-dev we have project (project) specific information and general (guides / commands / utils)
Still for context and project we need to load specific information from the project e.g. ( project structure, what files do what)

- [ ] we need to cleanup general part from (guides / commands / utils)
- [ ] we need to add project specific commands / utils / guides and ensure they are loaded together with the general one if present
