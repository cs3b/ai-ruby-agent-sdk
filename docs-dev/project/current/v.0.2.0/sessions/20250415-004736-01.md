# Context Loading Prompt: Start v0.2.0 Implementation

**Goal:** Begin implementation of the v0.2.0 release tasks aimed at streamlining the AI agent development workflow.

**Current State:**
- The v0.2.0 release plan (`v.0.2.0-StreamlineWorkflow.md`), ADR (`ADR-001-Unified-Task-Management.md`), workflow guide (`docs/unified-workflow-guide.md`), and supporting research are finalized in `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/`.
- Tasks `01` through `04` are defined in `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/tasks/`, outlining the necessary changes to documentation (guides, commands) and project structure.
- The experimental `task-manager` directory has been removed.
- The unified task system (`project/{backlog,current,done}`) with structured Markdown files is the standard.

**Files/Directories to Load/Review:**
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/tasks/` (Load all task files: `01-*.md`, `02-*.md`, `03-*.md`, `04-*.md`)
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/decisions/ADR-001-Unified-Task-Management.md`
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/docs/unified-workflow-guide.md`
- Key Guides to modify (as per tasks):
    - `docs-dev/guides/project-management.md`
    - `docs-dev/guides/README.md`
    - `docs-dev/guides/ship-release.md`
    - (Also remove `docs-dev/guides/prepare-release/prepare-release-documentation.md` as part of Task 03)
- Key Commands to modify/create (as per tasks):
    - `docs-dev/commands/` (Audit existing, update `load-env`, `lets-start`, `lets-spec-from-pr-comments`, `_review-kanban-board`, `self-reflect`, `lets-release`)
    - Create documentation for `lets-spec-from-prd`, `lets-spec-from-frd`, `log-session`.

**Next Objective:** Start implementing the changes outlined in the v0.2.0 tasks, beginning with **Task 01: Solidify Unified Task Management System**. This involves editing `ADR-001`, modifying `guides/project-management.md`, updating `lets-spec-from-pr-comments.md`, and ensuring the `task-manager` directory is removed.
