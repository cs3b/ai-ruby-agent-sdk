**Current State:**
- Tasks 01, 02, 03, and 04 for the v0.2.0 release are marked as `done`.
- All planned documentation changes (ADR, guides, commands) have been implemented via patches.
- The core artifact is the `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0-StreamlineWorkflow/` directory and its contents.
- Key changes include the unified task system (`project/{backlog,current,done}` with structured `.md` tasks), updated commands, refined guides, and new specification/logging commands.

**Files/Directories to Load/Review:**
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/` (Load this entire directory context)
  - `v.0.2.0-StreamlineWorkflow.md` (Review updated checklist)
  - `tasks/*.md` (Verify all are marked done)
  - `docs/unified-workflow-guide.md`
  - `decisions/ADR-001-Unified-Task-Management.md`
- `docs-dev/guides/` (Review key updated guides: `project-management.md`, `README.md`, `ship-release.md`)
- `docs-dev/commands/` (Review updated/new commands: `load-env`, `lets-start`, `_review-kanban-board`, `self-reflect`, `lets-release`, `lets-spec-*`, `log-session`)
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/test-cases/validate-new-workflow.md` (Test plan)

**Next Objective:** Begin the Quality Assurance/Validation phase for the v0.2.0 release. Execute the checks outlined in `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/test-cases/validate-new-workflow.md` and the "Quality Assurance" section of `v.0.2.0-StreamlineWorkflow.md` to ensure the implemented changes are correct, consistent, and accurately reflect the desired workflow.
