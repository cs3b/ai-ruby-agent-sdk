# Context Loading Prompt: Resume v0.2.0 - Validation Phase

**Goal:** Validate the documentation changes implemented for the v0.2.0 StreamlineWorkflow release.

**Current State:**
- All defined tasks (01-07) for the v0.2.0 release are marked as `done`.
- Documentation changes are complete, including:
    - Unified task system (`project/{backlog,current,done}` with structured `.md` tasks).
    - Updated/generalized commands (`load-env`, `lets-start`, `review-kanban-board`, `lets-release`, etc.).
    - Updated/generalized guides (`project-management.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `testing.md`, etc.).
    - New Project Blueprint (`project/blueprint.md`) and generator command (`generate-blueprint.md`).
    - New Structured Code Edits guide (`guides/structured-code-edits.md`) referenced in workflow.
    - Defined session logging (`log-session`) and release backlog (`lets-spec-from-release-backlog`) processes.
- The release overview checklist (`v.0.2.0-StreamlineWorkflow.md`) reflects completed implementation tasks.

**Files/Directories to Load/Review:**
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/` (Load this entire directory context)
  - `v.0.2.0-StreamlineWorkflow.md` (Review updated checklist)
  - `tasks/*.md` (Verify all are marked done)
  - `docs/unified-workflow-guide.md`
  - `decisions/ADR-001-Unified-Task-Management.md`
- `docs-dev/guides/` (Review key updated/new guides: `project-management.md`, `structured-code-edits.md`, etc.)
- `docs-dev/commands/` (Review key updated/new commands: `load-env`, `lets-start`, `generate-blueprint`, `log-session`, etc.)
- `docs-dev/project/blueprint.md`
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/test-cases/validate-new-workflow.md` (Test plan)

**Next Objective:** Begin the Quality Assurance/Validation phase for the v0.2.0 release. Execute the checks outlined in `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/test-cases/validate-new-workflow.md` and the "Quality Assurance" section of `v.0.2.0-StreamlineWorkflow.md` to ensure the implemented changes are correct, consistent, and accurately reflect the desired workflow.
