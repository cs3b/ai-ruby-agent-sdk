# Context Loading Prompt: Resume v0.2.0 Workflow Improvement

**Goal:** Continue refining the v0.2.0 release focused on streamlining the AI agent development workflow.

**Current State:**
- We have established the v0.2.0 release structure in `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/`.
- Key decisions are captured in `decisions/ADR-001-Unified-Task-Management.md`.
- The unified workflow is outlined in `docs/unified-workflow-guide.md`.
- Initial tasks for v0.2.0 are defined in `tasks/`:
    - `01-consolidate-task-systems.md`
    - `02-update-commands.md`
    - `03-update-guides.md`
- We just added task `04-define-session-logging.md` to capture requirements for logging agent interactions.
- Research files (`task-master-ai-hlo.md`, `windsurf-tips.md`) supporting the workflow improvements are located in `researches/`.
- The experimental `task-manager` directory has been removed.
