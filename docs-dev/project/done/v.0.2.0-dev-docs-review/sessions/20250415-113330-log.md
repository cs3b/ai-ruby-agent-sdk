# Session Log: 2025-04-15 02:15:30

## Request Summary
User requested creation of new tasks (05, 06, 07) for v0.2.0 based on backlog notes, provided feedback refining tasks 06 (add Project Blueprint concept) and 07 (separate context loading from task execution guidance), and then asked to log the session.

## Agent Action Summary
- Created task files:
    - `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/tasks/05-define-release-backlog.md`
    - `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/tasks/06-separate-general-project-docs.md`
    - `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/tasks/07-refactor-context-loading.md`
- Generated patch to update tasks 06 and 07 based on user feedback, incorporating the Project Blueprint idea and clarifying the roles of `load-env` vs. `lets-start`.

# Context Loading Prompt: Resume v0.2.0 - Next Tasks

**Goal:** Continue work on the v0.2.0 StreamlineWorkflow release, focusing on the newly defined tasks.

**Current State:**
- Tasks 01, 02, 03, and 04 are implemented and marked `done`. Documentation changes related to the unified task system, command updates, guide consolidation, and initial session logging definition are complete.
- New tasks 05, 06, and 07 have been defined and refined based on backlog items and user feedback:
    - `05-define-release-backlog.md`: Process for handling in-release feedback for future releases.
    - `06-separate-general-project-docs.md`: Separate general vs. project-specific docs and introduce `project/blueprint.md`.
    - `07-refactor-context-loading.md`: Separate `load-env` (context) from `lets-start` (task execution flow).
- The core v0.2.0 documentation (`v.0.2.0-*.md`, `ADR-001-*.md`, `docs/unified-workflow-guide.md`) reflects the state after Task 04 completion.

**Files/Directories to Load/Review:**
- `docs-dev/project/current/v.0.2.0/` (Load this entire directory context)
  - `tasks/05-define-release-backlog.md`
  - `tasks/06-separate-general-project-docs.md`
  - `tasks/07-refactor-context-loading.md`
- Review the updated `tasks/06-*.md` and `tasks/07-*.md` reflecting the latest feedback.
- Re-check relevant commands (`load-env`, `lets-start`) and guides (`project-management.md`, `unified-workflow-guide.md`) in light of the planned changes in Task 07.

**Next Objective:** Begin implementation of the next pending tasks for v0.2.0, starting with **Task 05: Define Release-Specific Backlog Process**.
