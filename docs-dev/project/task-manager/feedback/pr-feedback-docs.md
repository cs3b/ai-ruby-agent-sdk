# PR Feedback Implementation Plan

## Logical Grouping of Feedback

### 1. Structural Reorganization (High Priority)
- [ ] Consolidate template folders (guides & project)
- [ ] Integrate transition checklist into project management
- [ ] Rename "Next" to "Current" in documentation
- [ ] Define dev session structure (per release/project)

### 2. Workflow Improvements
- [ ] Evaluate and integrate Task Master for release management
- [ ] Conduct workflow analysis and simplification
- [ ] Implement task manager integration

### 3. Documentation Enhancements
- [ ] Create high-level planning template (DSL/UI design)
- [ ] Update test coverage documentation
- [ ] Standardize version naming conventions

### 4. Technical Implementation
- [ ] Develop agent-oriented workflow analysis
- [ ] Create library usage/responsibility matrix

## Implementation Order
1. Start with structural changes (template consolidation, naming)
2. Implement workflow tools (Task Master, task manager)
3. Update documentation standards
4. Technical implementations last

## Timeline
- Week 1: Structural reorganization
- Week 2: Workflow tool integration
- Week 3: Documentation updates
- Week 4: Technical implementations

# PR Feedback Analysis

## Pull Request: https://github.com/cs3b/ai-ruby-agent-sdk/pull/1

**Note:** Due to potential limitations with the API, not all comments may be included in this analysis.

## Comments Analysis:

### 1. Test Coverage Clarification

*   **Author:** cs3b
*   **File:** `docs-dev/commands/lets-commit.md`
*   **Line:** 11
*   **Comment:** "test coverage is always true - just check the index in coverage directory"
*   **Analysis:** The comment clarifies how to check test coverage. It suggests checking the index in the coverage directory.
*   **Action:** Update the documentation to reflect this method of checking test coverage. Provide a specific example or command to check the coverage index.

### 2. Template Folder Consolidation and Task Manager Integration

*   **Author:** cs3b
*   **File:** `docs-dev/project/template/v.x.x.x/v.x.x.x-codename.md`
*   **Line:** 1
*   **Comment:** "we should have only one template folder (guides & project are duplications)\r\n\r\nalso as mention before - incorporate task manager within the workflow"
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The comment suggests consolidating the `guides` and `project` template folders into one to avoid duplication.
    *   It also recommends incorporating a task manager within the workflow.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Investigate the feasibility of consolidating the template folders. Analyze the contents of each folder and identify any overlapping or redundant files.
    *   Research and propose a task manager solution that can be integrated into the development workflow. Consider factors such as ease of use, features, and compatibility with the existing toolchain.

### 3. Task Master Integration Proposal

*   **Author:** cs3b
*   **File:** `docs-dev/commands/lets-start.md`
*   **Line:** 15
*   **Comment:** "thinking about using task master - not project at all, for each release separate task master structure"
*   **Analysis:** Suggests adopting Task Master (https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) for release management rather than current project structure.
*   **Action:** Evaluate Task Master framework and create migration plan if suitable.

### 4. Naming Convention Clarification

*   **Author:** cs3b
*   **File:** `docs-dev/project/01-project-management.md`
*   **Line:** 22
*   **Comment:** "Maybe Next should be Current - in general way it makes it clear this is sth we are working now"
*   **Analysis:** Suggests renaming "Next" version to "Current" for better clarity about active development.
*   **Action:** Consider version naming convention across all documentation.

### 5. Transition Checklist Integration

*   **Author:** cs3b
*   **File:** `docs-dev/project/01-project-management.md`
*   **Line:** 45
*   **Comment:** "transition check list should be part of project management"
*   **Analysis:** Recommends moving transition checklist into core project management docs.
*   **Action:** Merge transition checklist into project management documentation.

### 6. Dev Session Structure

*   **Author:** cs3b
*   **File:** `docs-dev/project/template/dev-session.md`
*   **Line:** 3
*   **Comment:** "dev session is per release, or per project ... not sure - or it should be part of let's start or lets develop"
*   **Analysis:** Questions current dev session structure and suggests possible alternatives.
*   **Action:** Define clear scope for dev sessions in documentation.

### 7. High Level Planning Requirements

*   **Author:** cs3b
*   **File:** `docs-dev/project/template/implementation-plan.md`
*   **Line:** 8
*   **Comment:** "we should always have high level plan and ui (dsl in context of ruby lib) and maybe responsibility and what libs should we use and what for"
*   **Analysis:** Emphasizes need for comprehensive planning documentation including DSL design and library usage.
*   **Action:** Create template for high-level planning documentation.
